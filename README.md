# Titanic EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) - Day 1

This Jupyter Notebook contains the initial steps of Exploratory Data Analysis for the Titanic dataset. It covers loading the data, data cleaning, visualization, and analysis. The project is organized into multiple sections.

## Overview

- **EDA File:** eda_day1_nv.ipynb & eda_day1_titanic.py
- **Data Sources:** The data used in this analysis is provided in CSV files: `train.csv`, `test.csv`, and `gender_submission.csv`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this notebook, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

## Steps
Problem Statement and Data Collection: In this section, we load the Titanic dataset, including training and testing data.

Data Preprocessing: We perform data cleaning and preprocessing tasks, such as removing duplicate entries and unnecessary columns.

Data Visualization: Visualizations include histograms, box plots, and correlation heatmaps for various features.

Data Analysis: We conduct a preliminary analysis to explore relationships between features, such as survival rates by class and gender.
